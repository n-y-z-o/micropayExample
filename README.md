# (DEPRECATED) Nyzo Micropay example site content

This repository contains example content for a simple first-generation Nyzo Micropay site. This method of Micropay, which required a local application, has been eliminated in favor of the Chrome extension (https://github.com/n-y-z-o/chromeExtension) and Android app (https://github.com/n-y-z-o/micropayAndroid). Examples for these are available in the tech repository (https://github.com/n-y-z-o/tech) and displayed on the tech site (https://tech.nyzo.co/micropay).
