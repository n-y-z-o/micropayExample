<h1>Nyzo Micropay demo site, page 1</h1>

<p>
    This is page 1 on the Nyzo Micropay demo site. The page is located in a file named
    <span class="filename">1.html</span> in the <span class="filename">page</span> folder of the web directory. The
    Micropay server removes trailing <span class="filename">.html</span> from filenames when building paths. So, the
    path to this page is <span class="filename">/page/1</span>.
</p>

<p>
    This page does not require payment, unlike pages 2 and 3 on this site.
